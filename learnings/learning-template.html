  <p>
    A practical learning from repeatedly building small tools
    to solve concrete problems.

  <h2>Context</h2>
  <p>
    This learning emerged while working on multiple automation
    and operations tasks.
  </p>

  <h2>Observation</h2>
  <p>
    Small tools reach usefulness faster and generate feedback
    earlier than large projects.
  </p>

  <h2>Why this matters</h2>
  <p>
    It reduces wasted effort and increases the chance
    of solving real problems.
  </p>

  <h2>Rule of thumb</h2>
  <p>
    If a tool cannot be useful in one session,
    it is probably too big.
