  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p>
    I sell products on Amazon in Germany and ship most of my items via FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon), but some ASINs I ship via FBM (Fulfillment by Merchant). I have a DHL Business account, but there is no easy or affordable integration between Amazon Seller Central and DHL.

As a result, I had to manually create up to 10 shipments per day, repeatedly copying the recipient’s name, company, street, house number, postal code, and selecting the correct parcel template. This was a boring, repetitive task that took me around 30 minutes every day.
  </p>

  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>
    I vibe-coded a simple tool that converts Amazon delivery slips into a DHL-compatible CSV import.
  </p>
  <p>
    My workflow now looks like this:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Download the delivery slip as an HTML file</li>
    <li>Upload it to the <strong>FBM2DHL</strong> tool</li>
    <li>Generate a CSV for DHL <strong>"📦 DHL shipment data import"</strong></li>
    <li>Upload the CSV to DHL and generate all shipping labels</li>
    <li>Manually add the tracking numbers back into Seller Central</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    This saves me 10–30 minutes every day, and for the first time I don't dread creating shipping labels anymore.
  </p>

  <h2>Who is this for</h2>
  <p>
    Amazon sellers who mostly ship <strong>one ASIN per order</strong> via FBM.
  </p>

  <h2>Status &amp; Limitations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If you usually ship one ASIN per order, this tool can save you a significant amount of time.</li>
    <li>You can define unique carton dimensions and weights and assign one or more ASINs to each carton size.</li>
    <li>When an ASIN is detected in the delivery slip, it is automatically mapped to the corresponding package configuration.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For orders containing multiple different ASINs, a more advanced mapping logic would be required.
